Introduction:
    Brief explanation of the importance of communication and the growing demand for data transmission speed and its physical problems, introduce structured light methods as solutions to these problems, such as: 
    Bessel, Bessel-Gauss, Laguerre-Gauss, Hermite-Gauss, OAM.
    Objectives of the work
